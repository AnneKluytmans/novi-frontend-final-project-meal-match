## About The Project

This repository contains the frontend code for **Meal Match**, my final project for the frontend development module at [Novi University](https://www.novi.nl).
Meal Match is an interactive recipe discovery application designed to overcome the all-too-common problem of a *cooking inspiration crisis*. Whether you lack ideas, have limited ingredients available, or simply don‚Äôt know where to start, Meal Match helps you discover new and exciting meals tailored to your needs.

The application provides personalized recipe suggestions based on your mood, dietary preferences, available ingredients, or simply by browsing freely through recipes. With an interactive quiz, search features, and filter options, cooking becomes a fun and creative experience again. Users can also save their favorite recipes in a personal account, making it easy to revisit them later.
